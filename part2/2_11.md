While developing our ohtuprojekti [berrypickertracker's backend](https://github.com/marjanpoimijat/berry-picker-tracker-server) I made it so we could use containers in development. The docker-compose file creates two services: the Uvicorn backend, and a postgres database. The Uvicorn backend is built from the development environment. Developers can now reliably use the backend server locally, and use it to test the frontend app. I also refactored the tests so they use the database container, instead of sqlite.
